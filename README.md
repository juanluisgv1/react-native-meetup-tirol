## Tips and Tricks

* If you have a local network the prevents your phone from accessing the address that is printed when running the packager, you can often work around this issue by "tethering" your computer to your phone's internet connection. Some phones call this feature "mobile hotspot." While it's very convenient, if you have a data plan where you pay for data transfer you should be careful when using this feature, especially when installing dependencies from NPM.
